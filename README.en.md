## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The system adopts a modular design, mainly including the following core components:

1. **Data Collection Module**: Responsible for obtaining website content, domain name information, network features and other data
2. **Feature Extraction Module**: Extract valuable features from the collected raw data
3. **Risk Assessment Module**: Perform risk scoring based on rules and machine learning models
4. **Report Generation Module**: Generate multi-format detection reports
5. **Data Storage Module**: Connect to the database for data reading/writing and blacklist updating
6. **Task Scheduling Module**: Implement scheduled detection functionality

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Start

### 1. Environment Preparation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or use conda
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Blacklists (Optional)
The system has pre-configured blacklist files:
- `blacklist_domains.txt` - List of known malicious domains
- `blacklist_ips.txt` - List of known malicious IP addresses

You can add more entries as needed. The system also supports automatic blacklist updates from the database.

### 3. Database Configuration
The system supports obtaining URL and keyword information from MySQL database. The configuration is located in the `DB_CONFIG` variable in the code file:

```python
# Database configuration example
DB_CONFIG = {
    'host': '127.0.0.1',  # Database host address
    'port': 3306,
    'user': 'root',       # Database username
    'password': 'your_password',  # Database password
    'db': 'ntmv3',  # Database name
    'charset': 'utf8mb4',
    'cursorclass': pymysql.cursors.DictCursor
}
```

### 4. Basic Usage

#### Method 1: Detect Single URL
```python
from batch_website_detector import WebsiteDetector

detector = WebsiteDetector()
features = detector.extract_all_features("https://example.com")
risk_level, risk_score = detector.predict_risk(features)
print(f"Risk Level: {risk_level}, Score: {risk_score}%")
```

#### Method 2: Batch Detect from File
```bash
# Detect URLs from a file
python batch_website_detector.py -f sample_urls.txt -o results

# Directly specify URLs for detection
python batch_website_detector.py -u https://site1.com https://site2.com

# Specify number of concurrent threads
python batch_website_detector.py -f urls.txt -w 20
```

#### Method 3: Scheduled Task Detection
The system supports scheduled automatic execution of detection tasks, defaulting to once every 10 seconds:

```bash
# Start scheduled detection task
python batch_website_detector.py

# Custom detection interval (seconds)
python batch_website_detector.py --interval 30

# Execute detection only once (without scheduling)
python batch_website_detector.py --once
```

### 5. Using Test Script
```bash
# Run complete test
python test_detector.py

# Test a single website
python test_detector.py --single https://example.com

# Test batch detection
python test_detector.py --batch sample_urls.txt
```

## üìã Input/Output Formats

### Input Formats

#### URL List File Format
```

### Output Results

#### Result Files

After detection is completed, three files will be generated:
- `{prefix}.json` - Complete detection results (including all features)
- `{prefix}.csv` - Brief results (URL, risk level, score)
- `{prefix}_summary.txt` - Detection report summary

#### Risk Levels

| Level | Score Range | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| **High Risk** | 70-100% | High risk, suspected illegal website |
| **Medium Risk** | 40-69% | Medium risk, needs further verification |
| **Low Risk** | 0-39% | Low risk, relatively safe |

#### Example Output

```json
{
  "Website": "https://example123.tk",
  "Risk Level": "High Risk",
  "Risk Score": "75%",
  "Risk Description": "üö® This website has serious security risks\n‚Ä¢ Extremely short domain registration time (within 7 days)\n‚Ä¢ Contains sensitive content",
  "Detection Time": "2024-01-15 10:30:00",
  "Detailed Features": {
    "Domain Length": 15,
    "Domain Age (days)": 5,
    "Suspicious Top-Level Domain": 1,
    "Sensitive Word Ratio": 0.08,
    "Has SSL Certificate": 0,
    ...
  }
}
```

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### 1. Custom Sensitive Keywords

The system supports loading keywords from the database, or you can modify the keyword configuration in the `WebsiteDetector` class.

### 2. Adjust Risk Score Weights

Adjust the weights of various factors in the `predict_risk` method:

```python
# Domain risk factor
if features.get('is_new_domain', 0) == 1:
    risk_score += 25  # Adjust weight
```

### 3. Train Machine Learning Models

```python
# Prepare training data
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Features and labels
X = [...]  # Feature matrix
y = [...]  # Labels

# Train model
model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
model.fit(X, y)

# Save model
joblib.dump(model, 'website_detection_model.pkl')
```

### 4. Scheduled Task Configuration

The system supports configuring the scheduled detection interval through command line parameters, or you can directly modify the default value in the code:

```python
# Set default detection interval (seconds)
DEFAULT_INTERVAL = 10
```

## ‚ö° Performance Optimization

### 1. Concurrency Configuration

- **Low Concurrency** (5-10 threads): Suitable for poor network environments
- **Medium Concurrency** (10-20 threads): Balance between performance and stability
- **High Concurrency** (20-50 threads): Suitable for large-scale detection tasks

### 2. Cache Optimization

```python
# Enable DNS cache
import dns.resolver
dns.resolver.default_resolver.cache = dns.resolver.Cache()

# Enable request cache
import requests_cache
requests_cache.install_cache('website_cache', expire_after=3600)
```

### 3. Detection Timeout Configuration

You can adjust the timeout time of each module to adapt to different network environments:

```python
# Set default timeout time
session_timeout = 10  # seconds
subpage_timeout = 8   # seconds
```

## üö® Notes

1. **Network Permissions**: Ensure you have permission to access the external network
2. **DNS Configuration**: Check if local DNS configuration is correct
3. **Firewall**: May need to configure firewall to allow relevant ports
4. **Rate Limiting**: Avoid detection frequencies that are too fast to trigger target website protection
5. **Legal Compliance**: Only for legal security detection purposes
6. **Resource Usage**: Pay attention to system resource usage during large-scale detection
